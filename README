Roundcube plugin mailman_lists_addressbook

Exports mailman lists as Roundcube addressbook.

Usage:

Run lists2addrbook.php on every list change (addition, removal) or from cron.
This takes a few seconds so it can't be done on every request so we create a cache file this way.

Configuration:

add mailman_lists_addressbook to the $config['plugins'] array.

This plugin takes two configuration settings:

$config['mailman_lists_addressbook'] = true;
$config['mailman_lists_addressbook_cache'] = '/var/lib/mailman/data/roundcube_lists_addressbook.ser';

The first one enables this plugin, the second one is the path to the cache file.
